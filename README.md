# JavaScript Notes+Specs

I read some books:

* The Good Parts
* Functional JavaScript

And looked through some websites:

* Jasmine Introduction

And I took these notes.

## Notes?

Are written in javascript and markdown, and live in reasonably named
directories.

## Specs?

Let me interact with examples, and verify that they work as I'd
expect.

I start by bringing in dependencies per usual:

```
npm install
```

### One Time Run

If I want to see that things work, generally:

```
npm test
```

### Continuously Run

If I want to see that things work in several browsers, or I am
actively taking notes and writing specs and want to see that things
run each time I save:

```
npm start
```

And when I'm done I hit CTRL-C.
